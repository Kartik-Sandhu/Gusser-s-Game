 🎯 **Project Title:** Gusser's Game – A Multiplayer Number Guessing Game

 📖 **Description:**

**Gusser's Game** is an interactive and entertaining multiplayer game developed using Python. It simulates a number guessing challenge where one player takes on the role of the **Chooser**, selecting a secret number, while the remaining players act as **Guessers**, attempting to correctly identify the number within a limited number of attempts.

The game starts by prompting for player names and selecting a Chooser from among them. The Chooser securely inputs a secret number (hidden using Python’s `getpass` module), and the other players then take turns guessing the number. Each round allows all Guessers to submit their guesses, and the game continues until either:

* A player guesses the number correctly (in which case they are declared the winner), or
* The maximum number of attempts is reached (after which the Chooser wins).

The game includes basic error handling for invalid inputs and ensures a smooth and fair playthrough. It runs in the command-line interface and makes use of fundamental programming concepts such as:

* **Loops and conditionals**
* **Functions**
* **Lists and tuples**
* **User input and validation**

 🧠 **Educational Value:**

This project is an excellent way to practice core Python skills in a real-world scenario. It reinforces logic-building, control flow, and user interaction handling.

⚙️ **Key Features:**

* Supports multiple players
* Secure secret number entry for Chooser
* Limited guessing attempts
* Declares winner(s) or ends with Chooser as the winner
* Input validation and user-friendly prompts

💡 **Future Enhancements (Optional):**

* GUI implementation using Tkinter or PyQt
* Scoreboard tracking over multiple rounds
* Difficulty levels (e.g., number ranges, attempts)
* Save game history or session logs
